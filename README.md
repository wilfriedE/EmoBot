# EmoBot
An IRC bot that adds unicode emoji auto correction, based on [the emoji cheat sheet] (http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/).

	Type ``` Hello Channel :smiley: ``` from your irc client and EmoBot will follow up with
	``` nick means* ðŸ˜ƒ```

# Adding EmoBot to your channel
	- Invite EmoBot to your channel or
	- Add your channel name as "#channel_name" in the channels.json file on update EmoBot server would join those channels.

# Supported Emojies
	- Primarily unicode emojies: http://apps.timwhitlock.info/emoji/tables/unicode

# Optout
	- You can tell EmoBot not to autocorrect you by saying ```emo-bot optout```
	Note that emo-bot will only keep track of opt-out users as long as it is connected.
	When it disconnects and reconects it will automatically consider all users opted in.

# Optin after Optout
